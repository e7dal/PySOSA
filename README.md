# PySOSA

A python module for use in annotating data using the [SOSA (Sensors, Observations, Samples, and Actuators)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSASensor) ontology through the creation of RDF graphs.

## Contributing
This repo began at a hackathon during the Research Data Alliance 14th plenary in Helsink October 2019.  Student work to complete the module will **begin 18 November 2019** but is and always will be published openly under Apache 2.0.  PRs and issue submisstions are welcomed.

## About the LANDRS project under which this module is being developed
This is a project under development by the Sloan Foundation supported Linked And Networked DRoneS (LANDRS) project which is working to build foundational infrastructure for the support of Unmanned Vehicles.  Specifically this project is aimed at building ontologies and supporting code APIs to facilitate communities building applications that leverage the power of linked data and the semantic web to facilitate researchers capturing and publishing Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable data using UxVs (colloquially known as 'drones').  While focuses on small scale unmanned aerial vehicles the project intends to build infrastructure that is both scientific and usecase domain agnostic and which might serve a range of unmanned vehicles potentially including ground rovers, and watercraft.
